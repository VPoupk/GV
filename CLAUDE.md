## Post-Change Checklist

After every code change, always:

1. **Verify the live game** — Open/check the deployed game link to confirm the changes are reflected and working correctly before reporting completion.
2. **Commit and push** — Ensure changes are committed and pushed to the correct branch so the live link updates.

This applies to all changes, not just when the user reminds you.
