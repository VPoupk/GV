## Post-Change Checklist

After every code change, always:

1. **Commit and push immediately** — Automatically `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` after every change without waiting for the user to ask. Never require a reminder.
2. **Verify the live game** — Open/check the deployed game link to confirm the changes are reflected and working correctly before reporting completion.

This applies to all changes, not just when the user reminds you.
